# The_best_ghibli

The_best_ghibli is a project created to apply all knowledge I have acquired in these four weeks.
This project implemented the best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also it contains different typographies, colors, and images as background in its sections.
The project is available for mobile or desktop versions. Its content is adaptable to several wide sizes and has a breakpoint at 768px to change the positions of its elements.
You can interact with its links and buttons. These elements contain hover effects. In the same way, this "The_best_ghibli" has a menu window for the mobile version that allows you to interact with the webpage.
The "speakers" section was created dynamically with JavaScript using ab object to acquire the content to fill the information.
